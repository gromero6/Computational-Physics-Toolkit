## How to Compile

To create the executable `./main`:

```bash
cd build
cmake ..
make
./main
```

---

## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OWNER/REPO_NAME.git
cd REPO_NAME
```

### 2. Create your personal development branch
The owner's branch is called `dev` — choose a different name for yours:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-name
```

### 3. Make your changes
- Keep changes focused — **one feature or fix per branch**
- Try to limit edits to a single file when possible
- Excessive changes across the whole repository will likely cause merge conflicts and you will be asked to rewrite your contribution

### 4. Commit and push your branch
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Short description of what you changed"
git push origin feature/your-name
```

### 5. Open a Pull Request
Push your branch to GitHub and open a Pull Request targeting the `dev` branch. The repository owner will review it and decide whether to merge.

## Daily Workflow (after first setup)

```bash
# Always sync before starting work
git checkout feature/your-name
git pull origin dev

# Do your work, then commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "your message" -m "if needed give more detailed explanation here"
git push origin feature/your-name
```

---

## Branch Structure

```
main                  ← stable release, do not touch
dev                   ← owner's integration branch
feature/your-name     ← your personal working branch
```

---

## Rules

- Never commit directly to `main` or `dev`
- Always pull before starting new work (`git pull`)
- One pull request per feature or fix — do not bundle unrelated changes
- If your PR has conflicts, resolve them locally before requesting a review
